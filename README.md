## Link to a talk about `else`

[This talk](https://github.com/ericfischer/if-then-else/blob/master/if-then-else.md) is great, and lays out the history of if-else. [HN discussion](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=25406211).

## Link to C language history

[From the Internet Archive](https://web.archive.org/web/20080724200738/http://cm.bell-labs.com/who/dmr/chist.html).

In which I learn that the reason B and C use `break` (as opposed to a separate keyword like `endcase`) to escape out of `switch` statements, is that B was based on an older version of BCPL, before BCPL got the `endcase` keyword.

Interestingly, Perl 6/Raku re-introduced the difference with its `succeed` keyword.

## The separate compilation in ML was inspired by Modula

See https://github.com/masak/interesting-papers/issues/450 for details.

## Nim was inspired by Modula/Oberon

Its type and module systems were, according to [this HN thread](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=26275553).

## Timeline from Wikipedia

[This timeline](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeline_of_programming_languages) is a great resource and starting point for choosing influential languages.

## Where does `for` come from?

According to [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superplan),

> Superplan introduced the keyword "for" resp. the German
> [fÃ¼r](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/f%C3%BCr#German)
> with its [for loop](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/For_loop)
